SaaSquatch iOS SDK Sample app
=============================

The Sample app is a demonstration of an integration of the Referral SaaSquatch iOS SDK.

To learn how to intregrate the SDK as in this example, please see the [Quickstart Guide](https://github.com/saasquatch/mobile-sdk-ios/blob/master/README.md Quickstart Guide).

This is the iOS app for a fictional company called **SaaS**. There is a simple sign up and login system, which interacts with Referral SaaSquatch using the SDK.

The app demonstrates:
* How to register a user with Referral SaaSquatch.
* How to retrieve a user's information from Referral SaaSquatch.
* Validating a referral code and referring a new user.
* Retrieving information about referrals.
* Using the share links generated by Referral SaaSquatch to let a user refer others.


###Login

You can login using the email __"email"__ and the password __"password"__. The app will retrieve the information for the default user, then welcome them and show them their referral code and buttons to share.

###Registration

When a user signs up with **SaaS**, the app registers them with Referral SaaSquatch, so they can refer their friends to get discounts on **SaaS**. When a user signs up they can enter a referral code which the app will validate with Referral SaaSquatch, and then apply to the new user's account. The app will show them some information about who referred them, and then welcome them and show them their referral code and buttons to share.
