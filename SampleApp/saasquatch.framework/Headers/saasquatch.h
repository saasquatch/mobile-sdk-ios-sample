 * `Saasquatch` is the Referral Saasquatch iOS SDK which provides a set of methods for interfacing with Referral SaaSquatch. It can register user with Referral SaaSquatch, retrieve information about users and referral codes, validate referral codes, and apply referral codes to a user's account.

/*!
 *  Registers a user with Referral SaaSquatch.
 *
 *  @param tenant            Identifies which tenant to connect to. For your app, you will get two tenant aliases -- one for test mode and one for live mode. Test mode alias are prefixed with <b>test_</b> , for example `test_abhoihnqwet`.
 *  @param userID            A user ID from your system (must be unique for every user). We use this to uniquely track users, and lets us handle accounts that are shared between users.
 *  @param accountID         We use this ID to link a group of users together. [See Shared vs Solo Accounts]("http://docs.referralsaasquatch.com/shared-vs-solo-accounts/" See Shared vs Solo Accounts) to see what you should use here.
 *  @param userInfo          A Foundation object from which to generate JSON for the request.
 *  @param completionHandler A block object to be executed when the task finishes. This block has no return value and takes two arguments: **userInfo** the Foundation object containing the returned user information constructed from the JSON response, and **error** containing an NSError descibing the error if the request failed.
 *
 *
 *  @note The top level object in **userInfo** will be an NSDictionary containing the JSON data to be passed to the Referral SaaSquatch server. This requires the `secret`, `id`, and `accountId` values and can include several others. For a complete description see the Referral SaaSquatch REST API docs. Here is an example:
 *
 *  <pre>
 *  NSDictionary *userInfo = @{
 *      @"secret" : @"978-0440212560",
 *      @"id" : @"10001110101",
 *      @"accountId" : @"10001110101",
 *      @"email" : @"claire@lallybroch.com",
 *      @"firstName" : @"Claire",
 *      @"lastName" : @"Fraser",
 *      @"locale" : @"en_US",
 *      @"referralCode" : @"CLAIREFRASER"
 *  };
 *  </pre>
 *
 * @warning The secret is your password for authenticating the user. It should not contain sensitive user data such as their password. Make sure to save it somewhere, or else you won't be able to authenticate future requests for the user.
